# Airbnb-Udacity-project  
## Motivation
The project is about Airbnb pricing for Boston and Seattle cities.
Knowing what time of the year has the lowes pricing, and even making a model to predict the price is the most exciting thing that made me pursue this project.

## Installation
Using Anaconda is more than enough for executing this project.
#### Libraries needed:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

## File descriptions
* ".ipynb_checkpoints" is for jupyter notebook.
* "Plots" has all the output plots from the notebook.
* "Airbnb.html" is a html format of the notebook.
* "Airbnb.ipynb" is the executable notebook.
#### csv files
* calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
* listings, including full descriptions and average review score
* reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments

## Summary of the result
This project answers 3 business questiouns and creats a linear regression model to predect the price.
